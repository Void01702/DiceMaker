So uh i had this idea earlier when GMTK announced the theme of their game jam, but due to a lack of free time and coding skill i didn't participate in the gamejame itself, so now i'm doing a shitty proof of concept in C to see if my idea could be fun

The gameplay was inspired a lot by the tabletop game "Dice Forge", as well as roguelikes deck building games

So uh yeah that's it, if for some reason you find this github, then uh, have fun with this game, even though it has no graphics and isn't balanced and isn't finished in general
